Hi, I'm Juan Carlos!
=================================================================
Welcome to my site!. Here I try to publish what I do, that includes: notes, investigations, works, code. I hope this is useful to you, and if it is, please let me know.

About me
======================
I am currently a PhD student at the University of Lleida (UDL_) in the Research Group on Precision Agriculture (GRAP_) - Department of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering (EAGROF_). My work_ focuses on the application of photonic sensors, computer vision and spatial sampling methods to estimate fruit load in apple trees.

   * - Package
     - Description
   * - `AK_ACQS - Azure Kinect Acquisition System`_
     - AK_ACQS is a software solution for data acquisition in fruit orchards using a sensor system boarded on a terrestrial vehicle. It allows the coordination of computers and sensors through the sending of remote commands via a GUI. At the same time, it adds an abstraction layer on library stack of each sensor, facilitating its integration. This software solution is supported by a local area network (LAN), which connects computers and sensors from different manufacturers ( cameras of different technologies, GNSS receiver) for in-field fruit yield testing.
   * - `AK_SM_RECORDER - Azure Kinect Standalone Mode`_
     - A simple GUI recorder based on Python to manage Azure Kinect camera devices in a standalone mode. ( https://pypi.org/project/ak-sm-recorder/ )
   * - `AK_FRAEX - Azure Kinect Frame Extractor`_
     - AK_FRAEX is a desktop tool created for post-processing tasks after field acquisition. It enables the extraction of information from videos recorded in MKV format with the Azure Kinect camera. Through a GUI, the user can configure initial parameters to extract frames and automatically create the necessary metadata for a set of images. ( https://pypi.org/project/ak-frame-extractor/ )

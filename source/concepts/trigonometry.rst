Integration of trigonometric functions
======================================
Let us do some maths here!

We include no proofs whatsoever.

Integration
-----------
As the derivative of :math:`\sin x` is :math:`\cos x`, and that of :math:`\cos x` is :math:`-\sin x`, we have.. math::   \int_{a}^{b}\cos x dx = \sin b - \sin a

   \int_{a}^{b}\sin x dx = \cos a - \cos bIsn't that beautiful?

LaTeX is used for the formulas.

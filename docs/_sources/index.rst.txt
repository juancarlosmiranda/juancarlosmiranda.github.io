About me :)
======================
Welcome to my site!

Here I try to publish what I do, that includes: notes, works, code. I hope this is useful to you, and if it is, please let me know.
During my PhD, my work focused on the application of photonic sensors, computer vision and fruit load estimation in apple trees.
